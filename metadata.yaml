description: Known as one of the key figures in the 'weird' horror movement that arose
  in England and the United States in the early twentieth century, Algernon Blackwood
  was known for inserting surprising, often sophisticated twists into his tales. The
  Damned tells the story of a haunted house whose supernatural activity stems from
  an unlikely source.
